/*
Joey has been attacked by Joker . Bruce Wayne has deployed automatic machine
gun at each tower of Smith. All the towers in Smith are in straight line. You are
given no of towers 'n' followed by height of 'n' towers. For every tower(p), find
the height of the closest tower (towards the right), greater than the height of
tower(p). Now , Print sum of all such heights (mod 1000000001).

Sample Input:
9
112 133 161 311 122 512 1212 0 19212
Sample Output:
