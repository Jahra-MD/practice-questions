/*
 In the city of La La Land, the sports chief is to be elected. Mr. Jani, who himself is a great athlete, is standing for the position. It looks like a cake for him but it is not so. Throughout his career, he has been involved in many controversies and because of this the people are divided. To challenge him, Ms. Ramya has also submitted her application. She is a fierce lady with a great track record but is considered too strict with her discipline norms.


There are multiple departments in the sports authority. On the election day, each department is provided with an integer. It also means multiple persons from the same department have the same integer. 


Election Rules:

Different persons belonging to the same department, have the same integer.

Multiple votes with the same integer will be considered as a single unique vote.

To win, Mr. Jani should have atleast M unique votes. If not, then, Ms. Ramya will be elected as the Chief Officer.
