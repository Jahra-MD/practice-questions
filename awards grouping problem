/*
Amazon Prime Video is a subscription video-on-demand over-the-top streaming and rental service. The team at Prime Video
is developing a method to divide movies into groups based on the number of awards they have won. A group can consist of 
any number of movies, but the difference in the number of awards won by any two movies in the group must not exceed k
The movies can be grouped together Irrespective of their initial order. Determine the minimum number of groups that can 
be formed such that each movie is in exactly one group.

Example

The numbers of awards per movie are awards (1,5,4,6,8, 9, 21) and the maximum allowed differenceÂ is 3
